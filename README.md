# Shear API

An unofficial reimplementation for NeoForge "API".

Of course this repo contains bunch of NeoForge code, so it's LGPL 2.1 licensed.

[NeoForge source code](https://github.com/NeoForged/NeoForge)

## Why develop it?

* NeoForge assumes all mods are NeoForge mod, 
and sometimes Quilt mods doesn't implement some interfaces that NeoForge asks mods to implement.
* NeoForge uses many patches, and many Quilt mixins confidents with them.
* NeoForge and Quilt uses two transfer systems.
