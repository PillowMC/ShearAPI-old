# Shear API

An unofficial reimplementation for NeoForge "API".

## Why develop it?

* NeoForge assumes all mods are NeoForge mod, 
and sometimes Quilt mods doesn't implement some interfaces that NeoForge asks mods to implement.
* NeoForge uses many patches, and many Quilt mixins confidents with them.
* NeoForge and Quilt uses two transfer systems.
